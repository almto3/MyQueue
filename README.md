## App Idea
  Idea came from personal experience spending lots of time looking for a show or movie to watch on different streaming services like Netflix/Amazon/Hulu and forgetting about movies or shows that I had planned to watch. MyQueue solves this issue by allowing the user  to look through all the services they have available in one app.  Our app also allows the user to queue movies and shows, voila thatâ€™s why the name myQueue! The apk is included in this push, please download it and let me know what you think!!
