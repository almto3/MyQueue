Special Instructions:
- The app should function without any prior pre requirements.  One needs an
  android phone with at least android 4.0 while the app is targeted for android 
  6.0.

Features/Use Cases Completed:
- Welcome Screen - greets user on their first time opening  the app after 
  download
- Select Sources Screen - shown after the Welcome Screen on first use and 
  available in settings. User selects the sources they would like to see media 
  from.
- Browse Screen - used to browse Movies and TV shows.  Since we are not yet 
  pulling from the API, this screen shows 8 hard-coded posters of movies from 
  Netflix. Clicking on any of these movies takes you to their detail activity.
- Movie/Show Description - This shows the user the movie poster, name, release 
  year, rotten tomato sources, plot summary for a selected Movie or TV show.  
  This page is dynamic but again since we are not yet pulling from the API the 
  information is hard coded.
- Settings Screen - Access to reselect sources and AboutActivity.
