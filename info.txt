Special Instructions:
- The app should function without any prior pre requirements.  One needs an android phone with at least android 4.0 while the app is compiled with a target apk for android 6.0. Moreover, the movies and series activities need an active internet connection to function correctly.

Features/Use Cases Completed:
- Welcome Screen - The screen will greet the user on their first time opening the app after download. However, it will only run the first time the app is ran.
- Login Screen - Where users can make their accounts and then login to them. The app does save user preferences in the cloud and Queues tied to their login information.
- Select Sources Screen - After logging in, the user will be prompted to choose which streaming sources they would like to use. That user has to pick at least one source, and then they can also choose as many as they would like, even all the sources if they want to. After choosing whichever sources that are required, the user may change the sources later, by launching this activity.
- Main Menu - This is the main activity of the application. From here the user will be able to navigate to any of the  screens below. Moreover, whenever the user wants to go back from any of the screens mentioned below, they will be brought to this activity.
  - Movies Screen - Used to browse Movies. This activity will launch and pull movie information from Guide Box (the API) that we are using. And then display the list of movies, depending on the streaming source that the user chose. Also, at the top of the screen, there is a spinner option menu in which the user is able to change the streaming source and that will update the list of available movies.
  - Series Screen - Used to browse TV series. This activity is similar to the movies activity mentioned above. The only difference is that this activity handles TV series instead of movies.
  - Queue Screen - From this activity, the user will be able to access their queue. Which is the list of all movies and TV shows that the user has decided to bookmark or "queue". Each of the items in the queue can be clicked and the user will be taken to the activity below.
    - Movie/TV Series Description - This activity shows the user detailed information about the movie/TV series. These information include: the poster, the name, the release year, the IMDB score and lastly the plot summary for a selected Movie or TV show. This activity will only be opened from on the previous two activities. From this activity, the user will be able to add a movie/TV show to their queue or removing it.
  - Settings Screen - From the settings screen, the user will be able to change the app's settings and preferences. The activities below can be launched from this activity.
    - FAQ Screen - The frequently asked questions screen is a simple screen with text views that has instructions for usage of the app. The FAQ has been changed a lot during the development of this application and will probably be changed a lot more in the coming days and weeks.
    - About Us - Also a simple screen, which has some basic information about the devs and an email to contact us.
    - Log Out - Log out the user from the app, this button will take the user to the Login screen where they can either log back in or create a new user.
